-----INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS-------

1. Put the contents of the zip file somewhere on your hard drive (EXCEPT IN THE GAME FOLDER).

2. Open GameRanger and go to Edit -> Options...

3. Under the 'Games' tab, find The Rise of the Witch-king.

4. Now set the path under 'Location' to the executable path of the ModSwitcher (e.g. C:\Users\WizardKing\Desktop\ModSwitcher\lotrbfme2ep1.exe).
Note: the path above is NOT the path to the executable of the game!

5. Finally, make sure that you run GameRanger (and hence the ModSwitcher) with administrator rights (if you dont use the 'Set Game Version'
setting, this is probably not necessary).

-----HOW TO USE----------------------

- The first time you start the ModSwitcher, you will be asked to set the Game Path. This should be the path to the executable of the Game
(e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Lord of the Rings, The Rise of the Witch-king\lotrbfme2ep1.exe). The Gear button in the bottom
right of the main window allows you to alter the Game Path afterwards.

- Add mods by using the 'Add' button. A window will pop up where you can set all the necessary information. The last three options ('Extra Flags',
'Override Default Game Path', 'Set Game Version') are optional.

- Once you created a mod, you can edit the mod by double clicking it.

- If a mod is selected, you can remove it or set it as the current mod. When you press 'Start Game', the current mod will be launched.

- If you enable the option called 'Set Game Version' (in the Edit Mod window), you will notice that you have several options: RotWK 2.01,
RotWK 2.02 v8.0.0 and RotWK 2.02 v8.0.1. If you understand how switching between different game versions works, you can add more versions by 
editing the versions.xml file.

-----TIPS AND TRICKS-----------------

- By leaving the Mod Path field empty, you can add a 'mod' to the ModSwitcher that launches the base game. This allows you to easily switch between
mods and the base game.

- If you installed the Edain mod in a seperate game folder, you can use the 'Override Default Game Path' option to add a mod to the ModSwitcher that
launches Edain.

- Note that you can run the ModSwitcher without running GameRanger! This might be useful if you still need to configure (i.e. add mods) to the
switcher.

- You can actually use this switcher for bfme2 (and probably bfme1) as well! You only need to change the name of the executable of the ModSwitcher.

- You can run the game with 'Extra Flags'. A list of possible flags can be found here:
